<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal website. After graduating, I began applying to 
  various companies but faced challenges, especially when it came to 
  technical exams. I developed an interest in programming and started 
  learning it, but I found it difficult to understand. I once applied as a software 
  developer, and after the interview, I was told to go home. While leaving the 
  company, it sank in that I had been rejected.</p>

<p>After that rejection, I decided to enroll in an online class to learn full-stack 
  web development. Currently, I am working on this HTML website, which 
  serves as my first project for my portfolio. I am determined to continue learning 
  and developing my skills to prepare myself for my first job in the near future.</p>
